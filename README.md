# signal-clone-mobile
This is a clean clone of the Signal messaging mobile app built with React Native and Firebase.
This project is powered by Expo which allowed the installation of some set of dependencies from Android and iOS platforms.
I used React Native elements to style the UI in the same way you would use Material UI
Firebase from Google was used to provide Authentication and Database requirements
Some useful and popular features like React Navigation, React hooks(UseState, useLayoutEffect, useLayout etc) and React native 
elements ame in handy in this project.
I have a detailed description on my blog; justobioma.com. You are free to visit!
Also, you can find the web version online @ https://signal-clone-34612.web.app/
You can visit https://expo.io/@justobioma/sig-clone to check it out on your mobile!
Thanks and take care.
